# Unit-2-Project

This is my Unit 2 Project at Bloomtech where I predicted the prices of food sold in grocery stores in Europe and Asia. Through various tests and just overall inflation, 
I've noticed definite years where the prices spiked, mostly steady rising for the most part.

The libraries used for the project include Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn mostly used for the general code and graphs. In addition, a variety of SKLearn libraries were also used like the Random Forest, One Hot Encoding, GridSearch, Train_Test_Split, Randomized Search, and Pipelines to hold such libraries.
