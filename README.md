# Unit-2-Project

This is my Unit 2 Project at Bloomtech fka Lambda where I predicted the prices of food sold in grocery stores in Europe and Asia. Through various tests and just overall inflation, 
I've noticed definite years where the prices spiked, mostly steady rising for the most part. This iss not even comparing 2022 though you can only imagine how that would be. Of course this is not without any data engineering as this was a relatively large dataset, so much so that like I had mentioned, I had to limit it to Europe and Asia compared to the global scale. By conducting a train and test split on my data targeting prices, I was able to build both a Hot Encoder Model and a Random Forest Regression Model that helped me reach my conclusions.

The libraries used for the project include Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn mostly used for the general code and graphs. In addition, a variety of SKLearn libraries were also used like the Random Forest, One Hot Encoding, GridSearch, Train_Test_Split, Randomized Search, and Pipelines.
